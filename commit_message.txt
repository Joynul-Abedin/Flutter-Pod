Fix script hanging in pipe mode and improve documentation

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Script was hanging when running `curl | bash` due to interactive prompt
- Users couldn't use the one-liner command from README

SOLUTION:
- Added pipe detection to skip interactive prompts when script runs via `curl | bash`
- Script now automatically continues with basic error handling in pipe mode
- Added clear messaging about AI features being available via environment variable

DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Updated README with three clear usage options:
  1. Quick install (pipe mode, no AI)
  2. Interactive setup (download + run, with AI prompts)
  3. Environment variable setup (pipe mode with AI)
- Fixed examples to match actual functionality
- Clearer separation between interactive and non-interactive usage

BENEFITS:
- One-liner curl command now works perfectly
- No more script hanging issues
- Users can choose their preferred installation method
- Better user experience for all usage patterns
- Maintains all existing functionality

This resolves the issue where `curl | bash` would stop and hang,
making the script truly ready for public one-liner usage.
