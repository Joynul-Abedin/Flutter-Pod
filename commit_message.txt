Remove hardcoded API keys and make AI features optional

SECURITY FIX: Removed hardcoded OpenRouter API keys from public repository

- Removed hardcoded API keys from both Bash and PowerShell scripts
- Made AI error recovery an optional feature requiring user's own API key
- Added helpful instructions for users to get their own free API key
- Improved status messaging to clearly indicate when AI features are available
- Scripts now work without API key but with reduced AI assistance capabilities

This prevents API key abuse and rate limiting when scripts are run by multiple users
from the public GitHub repository. Users who want AI-powered error recovery can
easily get their own free API key from https://openrouter.ai and set the
OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable.

Benefits:
- Protects API keys from public exposure and abuse
- Maintains backward compatibility (scripts work without API key)
- Clear user guidance for enabling AI features
- Better security practices for public repositories
