feat: Add AI-powered smart installation with progress tracking

ðŸ¤– Enhanced AI Integration:
- Automatic AI consultation during package installation failures
- Smart dependency resolution with DeepSeek AI guidance
- Auto-retry mechanism with AI-suggested fixes applied automatically
- Proactive troubleshooting for Ruby, Java, Flutter, and all dependencies

ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking System:
- Real-time progress bar showing installation completion percentage
- Clear visual feedback for each installation step
- Unified progress tracking across all platforms
- Professional installation experience with progress indicators

ðŸ”§ Smart Installation Features:
- Bash script: Enhanced execute_with_ai_retry function for automatic error recovery
- PowerShell script: Invoke-CommandWithAIRetry with intelligent dependency resolution
- Background AI assistance for package manager issues (Homebrew, Chocolatey, APT)
- Automatic PATH refresh and environment setup after each component

ðŸ’¡ Intelligent Error Recovery:
- AI analyzes specific error contexts (Ruby gems, Java linking, Flutter extraction)
- Automatic command generation and execution for dependency issues
- Interactive fallback when auto-fixes fail
- Comprehensive error logging with AI-suggested solutions

ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Improvements:
- Single progress bar showing overall installation status
- No manual intervention needed for common dependency issues
- Seamless handling of complex dependency chains (Ruby -> CocoaPods)
- Professional installation feedback with clear next steps

Example: When Ruby installation fails due to missing dependencies, the system:
1. Detects the failure automatically
2. Consults AI with error context and system information
3. Receives specific commands to install missing dependencies
4. Auto-executes the fix commands
5. Retries Ruby installation successfully
6. Continues with CocoaPods installation seamlessly

The Flutter setup system now provides truly intelligent, self-healing installation
with minimal user intervention and maximum success rate!
