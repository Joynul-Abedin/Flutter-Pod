Fix Ruby version compatibility and enhance AI error handling

- Updated CocoaPods installation to properly handle Ruby version requirements (Ruby 3.1+)
- Added automatic detection and installation of modern Ruby via Homebrew
- Fixed gem environment configuration for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- Enhanced OpenRouter API calls with proper headers (HTTP-Referer, X-Title)
- Added debug logging for AI API responses to troubleshoot issues
- Updated API key for DeepSeek integration
- Improved error handling and retry logic for CocoaPods installation

This resolves the common issue where macOS systems with older Ruby versions 
(like 2.6.x) fail to install CocoaPods due to version incompatibility.
