#### Progress Notes:
- ✅ COMPLETED: Intelligent Flutter setup system with AI error recovery
- ✅ Tested successfully on macOS 15.3.2 (Apple Silicon)
- ✅ All scripts created with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Documentation and examples provided
- ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/Joynul-Abedin/Flutter-Pod

#### Final Summary:
Created a complete cross-platform Flutter setup automation system featuring:
- Bash script for macOS/Linux with Homebrew integration
- PowerShell script for Windows with Chocolatey integration  
- Built-in AI-powered error recovery using DeepSeek (no API key setup required)
- Zero-configuration intelligent troubleshooting and error resolution
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- Tested and verified working on macOS environment
- Ready for community use with seamless AI assistance

#### Latest Enhancement:
✅ BUILT-IN AI ERROR RECOVERY: Embedded OpenRouter API key enables automatic intelligent error recovery without any user configuration. The system now provides AI-powered troubleshooting out of the box!

#### Smart Installation System:
✅ AI-POWERED SMART INSTALLATION: Added intelligent dependency resolution with automatic retry system
- Real-time progress bar showing installation completion percentage
- Automatic AI consultation when package installations fail (Ruby, Java, CocoaPods, etc.)
- Self-healing installation that auto-applies AI-suggested fixes
- Seamless handling of complex dependency chains without user intervention
- Enhanced error recovery with proactive troubleshooting for all components

## Lessons

### User Specified Lessons
- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Don't use [Cursor] prefix in commit messages.

### Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
